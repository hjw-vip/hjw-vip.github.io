# Hi, welcome to my academic homepage! 👋
> PS: My personal Blog: [小H的个人空间](http://hjwvip.top)

I'm **Samuel Hu** (CN name: **胡峻玮**), a third-year undergraduate student majoring in **Software Engineering** at the **School of Computer Science and Technology** (School of Software Engineering), **Tongji University**. 

During my time at Tongji, I have participated in several research projects. I worked on a project led by Lecturer [**Tang**](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/info/1064/2776.htm) at Tongji University, which focused on the diffusion mechanism of user interests on recommendation algorithm platforms. I have also been involved in Professor [**Ye**](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/info/1122/3256.htm)'s lab at Tongji University, conducting research on AI-based Chinese character visualization technology. Additionally, I am currently part of Associate Professor [**Dong**](https://math.tongji.edu.cn/info/1255/9703.htm)'s research group, where I am exploring the application of reinforcement learning in financial investments. Meanwhile, I am currently working in Associate Professor [**Yan Liu**](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/info/1063/2763.htm)'s lab, focusing on large code models and AI4SE.

## Research Areas 📚

My main research areas include:

- **LLM4code**  
- **AI4SE**  
- **SE4AI**  
- **NLP**  
- **Data Analysis**  
- And more...  

If you are interested in these research topics, feel free to email me at [**Samuel Hu's Email**](mailto:m15844917507_1@163.com) 📧

Looking forward to connecting! 😊
